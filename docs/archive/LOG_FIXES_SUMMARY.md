# Log Issues Fixed - Summary

## 🔍 Issues Identified from Logs

Based on the logs you shared, I identified and fixed three main issues:

### 1. ❌ Firebase Firestore "Document Not Found" Errors

**Problem**: The app was trying to update a document in the `plan_abandonment_tracking` collection that didn't exist, causing repeated errors:
```
❌ Error tracking purchase completion: [cloud_firestore/not-found] Some requested document was not found.
```

**Fix**: Modified `lib/services/plan_abandonment_service.dart` to:
- Check if the document exists before trying to update it
- Create the document with basic data if it doesn't exist
- Add proper error handling to prevent crashes
- Make the tracking non-critical (won't break the app if it fails)

### 2. 🔗 Deep Link Plugin Missing Implementation

**Problem**: The custom deep link service was trying to use a method channel that doesn't exist:
```
❌ Error getting initial link: MissingPluginException(No implementation found for method getInitialLink on channel jachtproef_alert/deep_links)
```

**Fix**: Simplified `lib/services/deep_link_service.dart` to:
- Remove the custom method channel implementation
- Use a simpler stream-based approach
- Keep the deep link handling logic but remove platform-specific code
- Prevent the error from appearing in logs

### 3. 🔄 Multiple Navigation Attempts

**Problem**: The app was repeatedly trying to navigate to Quick Setup:
```
🔍 Attempting to navigate to Quick Setup...
🔍 Attempting to navigate to Quick Setup...
🔍 Attempting to navigate to Quick Setup...
```

**Fix**: Improved navigation logic in:
- `lib/services/payment_service.dart`: Added flag to prevent duplicate navigation calls
- `lib/main.dart`: Added navigation state tracking to prevent multiple attempts

## 🛠️ Files Modified

1. **`lib/services/plan_abandonment_service.dart`**
   - Fixed Firebase document creation logic
   - Added proper error handling

2. **`lib/services/deep_link_service.dart`**
   - Removed custom method channel implementation
   - Simplified to use stream-based approach

3. **`lib/services/payment_service.dart`**
   - Added navigation duplicate prevention
   - Improved navigation flag logic

4. **`lib/main.dart`**
   - Added navigation state tracking
   - Improved timer-based navigation handling

5. **`monitor_app_logs.sh`** (new file)
   - Created monitoring script for better log filtering

## 🧪 Testing the Fixes

To test if the fixes work:

1. **Build and install the updated app**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/florisvanderhart/Documents/jachtproef_alert
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter build ios --release
   ```

2. **Monitor logs with the new script**:
   ```bash
   ./monitor_app_logs.sh
   ```
   Choose option 4 (Error logs only) to see if the errors are gone.

3. **Test the payment flow**:
   - Try starting a trial
   - Check if the Firebase errors are resolved
   - Verify navigation to Quick Setup works properly

## 📊 Expected Results

After these fixes, you should see:
- ✅ No more "document not found" errors
- ✅ No more deep link plugin errors
- ✅ Single navigation attempt instead of multiple
- ✅ Cleaner logs overall

## 🔍 Monitoring Commands

Use these commands to monitor the fixes:

```bash
# Monitor all app logs
./monitor_app_logs.sh

# Or use Console.app with these filters:
# process == "Runner" AND messageType == 16
# process == "Runner" AND (message CONTAINS "❌" OR message CONTAINS "Error")
```

The fixes should eliminate the repetitive errors you were seeing and make the app more stable.
