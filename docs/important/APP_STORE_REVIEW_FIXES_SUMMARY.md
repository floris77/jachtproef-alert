# App Store Review Fixes Summary

## Review Rejection Issues & Solutions

### ❌ Issue 1: App Completeness - Login Redirect Bug
**Problem:** When tapping "start free trial" button, users are kicked back to the login screen on iPad Air (5th generation) with iPadOS 18.5.

**Root Cause:** Error handling in `PaymentService.startTrialWithPlan()` was throwing exceptions that caused navigation failures.

**✅ Solutions Implemented:**

1. **Enhanced Error Handling in Payment Service (`lib/services/payment_service.dart`):**
   - Added specific error handling for different purchase error types
   - Improved error messages for user-friendly feedback
   - Added null check for authentication state
   - Better handling of subscription purchase failures

2. **Improved Plan Selection Error Handling (`lib/screens/plan_selection_screen.dart`):**
   - Prevents navigation away from screen on errors
   - Shows specific error messages based on error type
   - Added retry functionality in error snackbar
   - Success confirmation before navigation

### ❌ Issue 2: Missing Required Subscription Information
**Problem:** The app's binary was missing functional links to Terms of Use (EULA) and Privacy Policy.

**✅ Solutions Implemented:**

1. **Added URL Constants (`lib/utils/constants.dart`):**
   ```dart
   class AppUrls {
     static const String privacyPolicy = 'https://florisvanderhart.github.io/jachtproefalert/privacy-policy.html';
     static const String termsOfUse = 'https://florisvanderhart.github.io/jachtproefalert/terms-of-use.html';
   }
   ```

2. **Created Compliant Terms of Use (EULA) (`terms-of-use.html`):**
   - Comprehensive subscription terms including:
     - Auto-renewable subscription details
     - 14-day free trial information
     - Automatic billing disclosure
     - Cancellation procedures
     - Pricing information (€3.99/month, €29.99/year)

3. **Updated Privacy Policy (`privacy-policy.html`):**
   - Added subscription and payment information section
   - Detailed explanation of data collection for subscriptions
   - Information about Apple App Store/Google Play payment processing

4. **Functional Links in App Screens:**
   - Added clickable privacy policy and terms of use buttons to:
     - Plan Selection Screen (`lib/screens/plan_selection_screen.dart`)
     - Subscription Screen (`lib/screens/subscription_screen.dart`)
   - Implemented `_launchUrl()` function using `url_launcher` package

### ❌ Issue 3: Misleading Subscription Marketing
**Problem:** App offered free trial without clearly indicating that payment will be automatically initiated for the next subscription period.

**✅ Solutions Implemented:**

1. **Enhanced Trial Disclosure in Plan Selection Screen:**
   - Changed header text to clearly state "14 dagen gratis proefperiode\nDaarna automatische verlenging"
   - Added detailed subscription information box with:
     - Clear auto-billing warning
     - Specific pricing information
     - Cancellation instructions
     - Reference to privacy policy and terms

2. **Improved Subscription Screen Messaging:**
   - Updated subscription information to emphasize automatic renewal
   - Added clear cancellation instructions
   - Included all required subscription details

3. **App Store Compliant Language:**
   - "Automatische verlenging: Na proefperiode wordt automatisch afgeschreven"
   - "Opzeggen: Voor einde proefperiode via App Store instellingen"
   - Clear pricing and billing cycle information
